# Twitter Redesign

Capstone Project of the Ruby on Rails Curriculum in Microverse.

The project is about creating an MVP of a Twitter like app with the implementation of the main functionalities.

- Users log in only with username (proper authentication was not a requirement)
  - Before a user logs in they can only see the Log in/Sign up page
  - When they log in they have full access to the app
- Users can create opinions about books which I have called tastes (like tweets)
- Users can follow other users and see what users are following them
- Users can add a profile photo and a profile cover image
  - They can upload those images when signing up 
- User can update all its data in the edit feature

- The app is an MVP of the full product - with the full graphical design, but only basic features that can be extended in the future.
